ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My passion lies at the intersection of technology and innovation. I enjoy working with others to build and improve software 

ðŸ’» On GitHub, you'll find a collection of my projects, ranging from personal experiments to contributions to open-source projects. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on more open-source projects.
